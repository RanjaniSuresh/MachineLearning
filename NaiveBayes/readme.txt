Question:

Implementation of Naive Bayes learning algorithm for binary classification tasks.
1. Train the Naive Bayes learning algorithm on the training instances. Print to stdout the parameters of the classifier that were estimated from the training data
2. Use the learned classifier to classify the training instances. Print to stdout the accuracy of the classifier.
3. Use the learned classifier to classify the test instances. Print to stdout the accuracy of the classifier.


Step 1: Install these packages
Packages : mice, VIM, corrplot, e1071

Step 2: 
Run the program from the console as : program_name("path to training data","path to testing data")
                                      nb_test("train-win.dat","test-win.dat")
                                      
This will import the data file and import all the required packages.

Step 3: 
The results will be written to console as shown in output file.
