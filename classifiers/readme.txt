Question:
 Analysis of different Classifiers in ML:
• Decision Trees
• Perceptron (Single Linear Classifier)
• Neural Net
• Support Vector Machines
• Naïve Bayes Classifiers


Step 1: Install these packages
Packages : rpart, rJava, neuralnet, party, e1071, corrplot, plyr

Step 2: 
Import the datasets given in the folder using the "Import Dataset" feature in R.
Click on "Import Dataset". Select "From text file" and select the dataset to be imported.

Step 3: 
Run the code. 
The results will be written to a text file (myoutput.txt) as follows:
Classfier - dataset - accuracy %

Note: The location of myoutput.txt will be usually the Documents folder else in the folder where the code exists.
